# Assignment-06
 
 Here is the NavMesh assignment.
 
 Example 1: Added obstacles and targets for the player to collect. Also changed the player model to the LowMan model. Score is displayed as well.
 Example 2: Added moving obstacles in addition to the targets. Score is kept in the left side of the screen. 
 Example 3: Made the obstacles generate at runtime using the level generator script. Added a score and changed the model to LowMan.
 Example 4: Made two seperate NavMeshes along with a NavMesh Link that let the player jump from side to side. Was able to make an enemy character chase the player however I could not script the AI to stay on one side.
 Example 5: Swapped the LowMan model with the Spider model. Animation slightly worked. Added a score display to the left side
